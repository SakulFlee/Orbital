# üõ∞Ô∏è Orbital Engine

_Orbital_ is a multi-platform 3D rendering engine built in Rust using WGPU as the graphics backend. The engine provides a flexible framework for creating 3D applications and games with support for modern rendering techniques including PBR (Physically Based Rendering), IBL (Image-Based Lighting), and GLTF asset import.

## Project Status

<div align="center">

‚ö†Ô∏è **PROJECT SUNSET ANNOUNCEMENT** ‚ö†Ô∏è

This project is currently **on ice**. After serving its intended purpose, development has been paused. While I may return to it in the future, there are no immediate plans for updates or new features.

However, the engine remains available for use, and **community contributions are welcome**! If you're interested in extending or updating the engine, I'd be more than happy to review and merge pull requests.

## Core Features

<div align="center">

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **PBR Rendering** | Physically Based Rendering with realistic material properties and lighting |
| **Image-Based Lighting** | Advanced lighting using HDR environment maps for realistic reflections |
| **GLTF 2.0 Support** | Full import capabilities for complex 3D scenes, materials, and animations |
| **Cross-Platform** | Unified rendering across desktop platforms via WGPU abstraction |
| **Modular Architecture** | Flexible element system with message-based communication |
| **Modern Shaders** | WGSL-based shaders for cross-platform compatibility |

## Platform Compatibility

- ‚úÖ **Windows**: Full support
- ‚úÖ **Linux**: Full support
- ‚úÖ **macOS**: Full support
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Web**: Theoretically possible but not currently supported
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Android**: Works but requires frequent updates to keep compatible
- ‚ùì **iOS**: Should work similarly to Android but cannot be verified

## Getting Started

To explore the capabilities of the Orbital Engine, check out the examples in the `Examples/` directory. These examples demonstrate various features of the engine including:

- **GLTF PBR Damaged Helmet**: Example showcasing PBR rendering with a damaged helmet model
- **Instancing**: Example demonstrating instanced rendering
- **PBR Grid**: Example showing the PBR material system
- **Roll Camera**: Example with camera controls
- **Skybox**: Example showing environment mapping

To run an example, use:

```shell
cargo run --bin <example_name>
```

To use the engine in your own project, add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
orbital = { path = "./Runtime" }
```

## Engine Concepts

### Elements

The primary way to add interactive objects to your world is through **Elements**. Elements are the core game objects that exist in the world and handle their own behavior. Each element can register itself with the world to define what resources it needs (models, cameras, etc.), and can respond to various events during the application lifecycle such as updates and messages from other elements.

### Messaging System

Elements communicate with each other and the world through a message-passing system rather than shared memory. This ensures loose coupling between elements and enables flexible, modular game design. Rather than sharing memory or directly accessing other elements, elements send messages to communicate. This approach is easily scalable - tags can be used multiple times, so messages will be automatically sent to all elements with a matching tag.

### World Architecture

The world manages resource stores (models, cameras, environments, lights), handles the asset import system, and creates the global bind group used by shaders. Resources follow a specific lifecycle involving creation, realization, caching, and cleanup.

## History

The Orbital engine has a rich history spanning multiple iterations and rewrites. The project originally started as "Akimo" and was written in Java as a pure CPU renderer for 2D graphics. Over the years, it evolved through multiple iterations:

- **Akimo (Java)**: Started as a CPU-based 2D renderer, then upgraded to use LWJGL for OpenGL and Vulkan support
- **Akimo (C++)**: A complete rewrite in C++ with Vulkan bindings, still under the "Akimo" name
- **Orbital (Rust/Vulkan)**: A rewrite in Rust but still using Vulkan bindings
- **Orbital (Rust/WGPU/WGSL)**: The current iteration using Rust with WGPU and WGSL, moving away from GLSL to a more modern shader language

Each version learned from the previous ones, with the current implementation built in Rust leveraging the WGPU graphics API abstraction layer for cross-platform support.

## Future Features & Missing Functionality

There are several features that would enhance the engine but are currently missing. These include:

- **Proper Frustum Culling**: Currently, the engine effectively realizes all BoundingBoxes/Models without checking if they are actually visible or not. A proper frustum check should be used to determine if models are visible or near the camera.
- **Performance Optimizations**: Various optimizations for rendering performance and memory usage
- **Additional Rendering Techniques**: Support for more advanced rendering techniques like shadow mapping, volumetric effects, etc.
- **Improved Asset Pipeline**: Better tools and workflows for importing and processing assets
- **Animation System**: More robust animation support beyond basic GLTF animations
- **Physics Integration**: Integration with physics engines for realistic interactions
